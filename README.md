## Run

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

The server is listening on `:1337`.
Don't use `localhost` or `lo` as WebRTC does not work well,
use your LAN IP (or WAN IP) instead, like `http://192.168.1.2:1337`.

## Known bugs

You can't enter the code with your keyboard, you must use your arrows instead.
